For benchmarking, we used Geekbench 3 from the Google Play store. For each configuration, we booted the device and waited a minute or two to let everything settle down and make sure there weren't too many other tasks running. We ran the standard Geekbench test 3 times for each configuration, and took the average value for the single- and multi-core scores. For our kernel, we adjusted the foreground task weight multiplier. The default was 10, to let each foreground task run for 100ms. We also tried 1, which gives a 10ms time slice, 5 for 50ms, 15 for 150ms, and 20 for 200ms.
